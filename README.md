To accompany the manuscript entitled: "Gender Can Influence Student Experiences in MD-PhD Training"

The repository contains raw data and code (Python 3) to generate figures 1, 2, and 3 in this paper. 

**Figure 1**. Program gender demographics varied over time. Yearly program size by gender shows female representation has varied, but has been increasing in recent years. The total number of female students in the program each year is represented by light-grey circles; the total number of male students in the program each year is represented by dark-grey squares. 

**Figure 2**. Invited guest and faculty speakers at the annual symposium are more likely to be male. (A) Likelihood of male or female students being invited to speak at symposium was determined using the proportion of male and female students invited over total male and female students, respectively, analyzed by unpaired t-test. Female and male students were equally likely to be invited to speak at symposium (p=0.88). (B) Faculty speakers were significantly more likely to be male (p=0.001) by chi-square analysis. (C) Invited keynote speakers were significantly more likely to be male (p<0.01) by chi-square analysis. 

**Figure 3**. Number of total and first-author publications by gender. Publications counts are from MSTP students while they are students in teh program. These data are from students who graduated between the years 2009 - 2019. There are no statistically significant differences in first author and total publications from men and women. However, male students, on average, graduate with one additional paper compared to female students. 

### Dependencies
All required dependencies are imported into the Jupyter Notebook Files as they are run. 

### To run 
Navigate to the `code` directory and launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line by typing `Jupyter Notebook`. Run each script in full or cell by cell. 

## Output
These scripts should generate a PDF and save it to the `figure` directory.
